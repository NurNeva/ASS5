        <h3>Santorini</h3>
        <p>
          Santorini is one of the Cyclades islands in the Aegean Sea. It was
          devastated by a volcanic eruption in the 16th century BC, forever
          shaping its rugged landscape. The whitewashed, cubiform houses of its
          2 principal towns, Fira and Oia, cling to cliffs above an underwater
          caldera (crater). They overlook the sea, small islands to the west and
          beaches made up of black, red and white lava pebbles.

        <h3>Cappadocia</h3>

          Cappadocia, a semi-arid region in central Turkey, is known for its
          distinctive “fairy chimneys,” tall, cone-shaped rock formations
          clustered in Monks Valley, Göreme and elsewhere. Other notables sites
          include Bronze Age homes carved into valley walls by troglodytes (cave
          dwellers) and later used as refuges by early Christians. The 100m-deep
          Ihlara Canyon houses numerous rock-face churches.

            <h3>Machu Picchu</h3>
            <p>
              Machu Picchu is an Incan citadel set high in the Andes Mountains in
              Peru, above the Urubamba River valley. Built in the 15th century and
              later abandoned, it’s renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone walls
              that fuse huge blocks without the use of mortar, intriguing buildings
              that play on astronomical alignments and panoramic views. Its exact
              former use remains a mystery.
